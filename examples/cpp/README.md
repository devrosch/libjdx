# C++ Example

An C++ example application that reads JCAMP-DX files using libjdx.

## Prerequisites

The same prerequisites as for libjdx are required. See top level README for details.

## Run example

To build and run the application, in the `examples/cpp` directory run:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./exampleapp
```

This will run the example application and print its output to stdout.
